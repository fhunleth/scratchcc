Things to fix for the next spin:

1. The holes for the motor driver are too small for the .1" posts that are used.
2. Not a huge problem, but there's a small clearance issue above the Leonardo's
   power jack. Keep through-hole parts out of this area
3. Make two bump sensor connectors
4. Add more to the silk screen so that it's easier to figure out the orientation
   of the LEDs connection, the Line connection, bump. Mark ground on the motors.
5. Add EEPROM to store motor calibration
6. Figure out how to reduce buzzing through speaker when not playing notes.
